Title: Calculate Optical Band Gap of Semiconductors from UV-Vis Spectra using the Tauc Method
Version: 0.5.0.9000
Author: Taha Ahmed
Maintainer: Taha Ahmed <taha@chepec.se>
Description: This package determines the optical band gap by applying the Tauc plot method
    to UV-Vis absorbance spectra. This method is commonly used for semiconductors with
    direct or indirect band gaps, such as oxides, sulfides, and many others.

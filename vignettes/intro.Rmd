## Introduction

For a direct band gap semiconductor, such as ZnO, the product of
its absorption coefficient $\alpha$ and incident photon energy $hv$
is proportional to the square root of the energy difference between its
band gap $E_\text{g}$ and the incident photon energy $E$:

$$
\alpha hv \propto (E - E_\text{g})^{1/2}
$$

which can be transformed based on the definition of absorbance, $A$, to

$$
(Ahv)^2 \propto E - E_\text{g}
$$


To determine the optical band gap of a crystalline semiconductor,
the ordinate is given by $\alpha^{1/r}$, in which the exponent denotes
the nature of the transition:

+ $r = 1/2$ for direct allowed transitions,
+ $r = 3/2$ for direct forbidden transitions,
+ $r = 2$ for indirect allowed transitions,
+ $r = 3$ for indirect forbidden transitions.


A Tauc plot is usually performed manually, that is, the band edge region is identified
visually, and then a linear fit to the linear part of the band edge is performed manually
and the intersect with the abscissa is calculated to arrive at the optical band gap.

If you have a large number of spectra, say from a time series experiment, its unusual for
the band edge to stay constant over time, e.g., due to changing particle size, and so
calculating the band gap by hand for each spectrum quickly becomes tedious.

We have developed a semi-automatic algorithm,
that only requires you to supply four *x* values: 
**two values that define the "plateau" on the low-energy side of the band edge**, and 
**two values that define the "plateau" on the high-energy side of the band edge**.

This algorithm takes the energy and absorbance of a single spectrum as input,
and returns the calculated optical band gap, as well as the fitted Tauc line
and its goodness-of-fit parameters (adjusted R-squared and number of points).

Note that this package expects you to supply the UV-Vis spectrum as 
absorbance (unitless) vs energy (in electronvolts).

```{r sketch, results="markup", out.width="100%"}
include_graphics(here("man/figures/sketch.png"))
```

This sketch is a visual attempt to describe the algorithm we have developed.
The minimum necessary input is `highE.limits` and `lowE.limits`, which define
the dark green and dark red circles, respectively.
Using these x-values, we find all spectral datapoints inside their defined ranges
and create two linear fits, that define the "floor" (red line)
and "ceiling" (green line) below and above the band edge, respectively.
The vertical extent of the band edge can then be calculated (dashed orange line, `ceiling2floor`), 
and finally a subset of vertical range, whose extent is defined by the input parameter 
`bg.limits` (which defaults to `c(0.3, 0.8)` of the floor-to-ceiling distance), 
is used to select the spectral datapoints that are fitted linearly (solid orange line).
The intersect of this linear fit with the x-axis is the optical band gap.


```{r datareset, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# note for posterity - this is how data/UVVisDataZnO.rda was created
# original data source: /media/bay/taha/chepec/papers/01_drafts/P12-ZnO-QDs-sizes-photocatalysis/data/abs-pc-spectra-N04H-small-nostir.rda.gz
# was manually copied to inst/extdata/spectra.rda.gz
# exp_data <- common::LoadRData2Variable(here("inst/extdata/spectra.rda.gz"))
# UVVisDataZnO <-
#    exp_data %>%
#    filter(
#       wavelength < photoec::energy2wavelength(2.5) &
#       wavelength > photoec::energy2wavelength(4.5)) %>%
#    select(-range, -DateTime) %>%
#    mutate(time = sampleid %>% gsub("^N04H-", "", .) %>% as.numeric()) %>%
#    select(sampleid, time, everything())
# usethis::use_data(UVVisDataZnO, compress = "bzip2", overwrite = TRUE)
```

This package includes a dataset with 141 UV-Vis spectra from an experiment
on growing colloidal ZnO nanoparticles. This data is a subset of the data
behind our publication (see Ahmed & Edvinsson, JPCC 2020).



## Working with a single spectrum

```{r ref.label="parameters", echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
```

```{r dataset, echo=TRUE, results="markup"}
this.data <- uvvistauc::UVVisDataZnO
# convert wavelength in nm to energy in eV
this.data %<>% mutate(energy = photoec::wavelength2energy(wavelength))
```


```{r single-spectrum-call, echo=TRUE, results="markup"}
this.spectrum <-
   this.data %>%
   filter(sampleid == "N04H-00000")
spectrum <-
   uvvistauc::tauc(
      energy       = this.spectrum$energy,
      absorbance   = this.spectrum$intensity,
      r            = r,
      lowE.limits  = lowE.limits,
      highE.limits = highE.limits,
      bg.limits    = bg.limits)
```

```{r single-spectrum-plot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(spectrum) +
   coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 7), xlim = c(3.0, 4.3)) +
   geom_line(aes(energy, fit.tauc), colour = "orange", size = 1.5, alpha = 0.65) +
   geom_point(aes(energy, absorbance)) +
   geom_line(aes(energy, absorbance)) +
   geom_line(aes(energy, floor), colour = "red") +
   geom_line(aes(energy, ceiling), colour = "#008000") +
   geom_point(
      aes(energy, absorbance),
      colour = "orange", size = 1.5,
      data = spectrum %>% filter(edge == TRUE)) +
   labs(x = "E/eV", y = paste0("(Abs)<sup>", 1/r, "</sup>")) +
   theme(axis.title.y = element_markdown())
```



## Working with multiple spectra

The `uvvistauc()` takes one one spectrum at a time.
The easiest way to work around this intended limitation is to wrap
the function call inside a loop.

What follows is a simple demonstration of this approach,
using the ZnO dataset included with this package.

```{r multi-spectra-call, cache=TRUE}
# individual spectra in the dataset are identified by their sampleid
sampleids <- this.data %>% pull(sampleid) %>% unique()
# create a tibble of sampleids and input params
# if you want to customise *.limits for each spectrum, supply a vector
# for each column instead of a single value
tauc.params <-
   tibble(
      sampleid = sampleids,
      lowE.min = min(lowE.limits), lowE.max = max(lowE.limits),
      highE.min = min(highE.limits), highE.max = max(highE.limits),
      bg.min = min(bg.limits), bg.max = max(bg.limits))
# empty dataframe that we will populate in the loop
spectra <- data.frame()
for (s in 1:length(sampleids)) {
   spectra <- 
      bind_rows(
         spectra,
         bind_cols(
            # we want to save sampleid and time columns from the data dataframe into the spectra df
            sampleid = sampleids[s],
            time = (this.data %>% pull(time) %>% unique())[s],
            uvvistauc::tauc(
               energy = this.data %>% filter(sampleid == sampleids[s]) %>% pull(energy),
               absorbance = this.data %>% filter(sampleid == sampleids[s]) %>% pull(intensity),
               r = 0.5,
               lowE.limits = 
                  c(tauc.params %>% filter(sampleid == sampleids[s]) %>% pull(lowE.min),
                    tauc.params %>% filter(sampleid == sampleids[s]) %>% pull(lowE.max)),
               highE.limits = 
                  c(tauc.params %>% filter(sampleid == sampleids[s]) %>% pull(highE.min),
                    tauc.params %>% filter(sampleid == sampleids[s]) %>% pull(highE.max)),
               bg.limits = 
                  c(tauc.params %>% filter(sampleid == sampleids[s]) %>% pull(bg.min),
                    tauc.params %>% filter(sampleid == sampleids[s]) %>% pull(bg.max)))))
   message(paste("Completed", sampleids[s]))
}
```

We can quickly create a rudimentary plot demonstrating the fitted "ceiling" (green) and "floor" (red) across
the whole dataset, as well as the Tauc line itself (orange).

```{r multi-spectra-plot, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(spectra, aes(group = sampleid)) +
   coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 7), xlim = c(3, 4.4)) +
   geom_line(aes(energy, floor), colour = "red", size = 0.2, alpha = 0.4) +
   geom_line(aes(energy, ceiling), colour = "#008000", size = 0.2, alpha = 0.4) +
   geom_line(aes(energy, absorbance), colour = "black", size = 0.3) +
   geom_line(aes(energy, fit.tauc), colour = "orange", size = 0.3, alpha = 0.6) +
   labs(x = "E/eV", y = paste0("(Abs)<sup>", 1/r, "</sup>")) +
   theme(axis.title.y = element_markdown())
```

We can also get a quick measure of the goodness of Tauc fit across all spectra by inspecting the
statistics of the adjusted R-squared and the number of fitted datapoints:

```{r fitstat, echo=TRUE, results="markup"}
summary(spectra$fit.adj_rsq)
summary(spectra$fit.points)
```

The summary statistics can also be plotted, along with the calculated band gap values.

```{r fitstatplot, echo=TRUE}
p1 <- ggplot(spectra) +
   geom_point(aes(time, fit.Eg)) +
   theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 11), axis.title.x = element_blank())
p2 <- ggplot(spectra) +
   geom_point(aes(time, fit.adj_rsq)) +
   theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 11), axis.title.x = element_blank())
p3 <- ggplot(spectra) +
   geom_point(aes(time, fit.points)) +
   labs(x = "Time/min") +
   theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 11))
plot_grid(p1, p2, p3, nrow = 3, align = "v")
```

From all this we can tell that for this dataset, the Tauc fits have a high quality
over the entire dataset: R-squared values are very close to unity, and the number
of fitted points never dip below 12, mostly staying around 20.




## Animated visualisation of this package's Tauc algorithm

In this animation, we step through each spectrum (black) in our dataset,
showing its "ceiling" (green, based on the user-supplied `highE.limits`)
and its "floor" (red, based on the user-supplied `lowE.limits`),
as well as the actual data points that the algorithm selected for fitting
(yellow circles), the resultant linear fit (orange), and the intersect
of the Tauc fit with the x-axis (large black circle).

I think this animation is really neat, but then I'm partial, of course ;-)
